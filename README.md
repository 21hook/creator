# Creator Pattern
### Implementing a Creator/Builder using JavaScript

Creator/builder pattern: the template of creting an object; seperate the representation & behaviour of  an object


1. Design needs: readibility, reusability, maintance(change once, change everywhere), 
	
2. Design means: defining a class to repersent a set of objects



3. Design benifits: 
From the implementor's perspective: separation of representation & behaviour, abstraction boundary, information hiding

From the client's perspective: no need to worry about the implement details, easily to use

### Design Abstract
